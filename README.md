- Manual gradient descent
- ReLU activation
- NumPy only

## Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (depending on project)
- Matplotlib for visualization

## Usage

Open the notebook and run all cells to see the implementation and results.

## Dataset

The project uses publicly available datasets suitable for the task.

## Results

The implementation demonstrates the algorithm working correctly with detailed outputs and visualizations.
